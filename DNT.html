            <p>I’ve always loved teaching and that led me to volunteering at an organisation called Dys and That. It is a center that teaches kids with learning disabilities and helps with their general cognitive development. After a few days of volunteering, I soon started teaching with ease, and was able to help a lot of children with dyscalculia understand mathematics.  </p> 
            <p>But, there was still one thing that made me feel like I haven’t done enough - as a lover of books. Most of the kids there have never read a proper book in their life because of their learning disabilities. So, I introduced them to audible. But, it was too limiting. I wanted them to be able to listen to anything they laid their eyes on. This motivated me to create an application for all the kids who go there. I used Google’s Vision API and Amazon’s Polly API to create an application that would allow the kids to take a picture of anything they want, extract the text from the image, and read it to them.</p>
            <p>I've attached a few screenshots of the application's user interface. The first screen allows the user to take a picture of anything they wish. The second screen shows a picture I took of a page in Sapiens, a novel by Yuval Noah Harari. The third image shows the text that has been extracted from the image using the Vision API which is then converted to an auido file using Polly and read out to the user at their preferred pace.</p>

            <center><h4> Screenshots of My Application </h4></center>

            <p>Overall, my time at Dys and That was extremely challenging, and truly rewarding. It has expanded my perspective, helped me grow, and strengthened my belief in digital solutions to effect change.
