            <p>DocTalk is a fast-growing Indian healthcare startup based in my city of Hyderabad, backed by some of the worldâ€™s foremost investors. At DocTalk I was tasked with leading grassroots operations and overseeing user acquisition and onboarding in rural areas surrounding Hyderabad. To make sure that the app was compatible with the rural population's requirements, I translated key sections of the app into Telugu, the local language (Below are a couple of the translated screens). Furthermore, I built a probabilistic model that predicted vitals' values before they were recorded to allow patients to enter their daily vitals more efficiently. Unfortunately I cannot dive further into the details of my work at DocTalk as I signed a non-disclosure agreement. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of my NDA I'm unable to disclose details of my work other than the screenshots that I shared above.</p>
