            <p>I’ve been a part of the Interact Club from 9th grade &mdash; first as a member in my former high school and then as the Director in my current high school. Though the club was run by the school, we mostly performed our activities as an individual body which allowed the members of the club to learn a lot about running an organization. As the director, I spent many days (and nights) visiting various offices to find sponsors, scouting for locations for our events, and typing up key notes, proposals, and summaries. Then came the task of assigning roles, setting up venues/ gathering requirements, and managing finances. In retrospect, it was all worth it. <br><br>
            We undertook multiple projects- 
            <ul>
            <li>Raised funds, found sponsors, and organised an energy conservation drive (500 people participated)</li>
            <li>Set up a library and a water tank at a government school</li>
            <li>Conducted free eye check-ups in slums and distributed specs accordingly</li>
            <li>Collaborated with ICs of other schools and conducted a inter-school tournament for various government schools at different venues</li> 
            <li>Spend time with kids in an orphanage, and in a cancer hospitals every year on children’s day and sankranti. </li>
            <li>Distributed eco&ndash;friendly ganeshas and diyas on ganesh chaturthi and diwali respectively to kids in a government school. </li>
            <li>Provided kids of 3 government schools with books, uniforms, and stationery. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, at the annual Rotary International of Hyderabad Deccan meetings, we got to speak about everything we’ve done in that year and listen to everything that our fellow clubs have accomplished . This truly made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself. I wish to take the lessons I’ve learnt and experiences I’ve had through the Interact Club and use them to make an impact on society.
